Know your users (or find your Persona) to build the right solution for the right audience.
Customers are the ultimate reason your company exists. As a PM, you need to understand and represent your customer.
- A persona represents a group of customers. 
- It is general description of traits that represent one category of customers.
- It is the key element of user-centered design.

Persona vs Customer : 
	Persona is a tool to help you understand customers
	Customer is a specific instance of persona.

You don’t sell to personas, you sell to customers.
Companies might have the same customers but use different personas.

Define Personas with Traits, Dimensions, Attributes.
Should Personas be real ? Make them as real as possible.
Focus instead on the common attributes and goals personas share, such as “new parent” rather than specific demographics.
But if demographics are relevant, then they’re OK to include (income is often a factor in tech). ‘Everyone’ isn’t a persona.
Generally, companies have more than one category of user, so they have multiple personas.

Things to consider while making Persona :
 - What are this person’s goal ?
 - What’s going on in this person’s life ?
 - What’s the context this person will use your product in ?
 - What’s this person doing for a solution right now (if any)

Be authentic and learn as you go. Your product is not perfect and not everything for everyone. You got to start somewhere.
Know your users (or find your Persona) to build the right solution for the right audience.
