Core values are the foundation of a product-
  1) What's the companies mission
  2) Is it building the right products
  3) Is it making the right decisions
  4) What to focus on revenue or customer values
  
It's not always data that helps in making a decision. It's the core value, or what the product stands for which helps in making the right decision.
