Metrics are the measurement of an action.
Metrics are the way you understand if your intuition is right.
Metrics allow you to understand how users are using your products.
Metrics help you know if users are happy with your product.

They give us real data about what customers are doing.
If a certain metric isn’t where we want it to be, we can set a goal for it, make a product change, and re-measure the metric to see if our change helped.

Metrics lets us figure out what is going on with our product. It is real data about your product what customers are doing with our product and how their behavior changes over time.
If certain metric isn’t where you want to be then -
Set a goal
Make changes to product
Remeasure

Also if we are falling short of a metric , we make hypothesis and make changes to our product and come back and remeasure.
